      <li><b class="text-left" style="font-size: 30px;">Setting up the scene</b></li>
      
      <p>For our scene , we chose to put 3 spheres on one plane. We have set up a light source from which the light rays are emitted. Currently , the balls are in the colours of blue , purple and golden yellow. A white light source has been setup some distance away from the 3D location of it. To improve our accuracy and implementation of the ray tracer, we have made alternate black and white squares on the plane , like a chess board. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The scene is an array consisting of all of our objects.The members of the scene respectively are sphere 1, sphere 2 , sphere 3 and a plane.</p><br>
      <p>For making sphere , we have created a function "add_sphere()" . It has the following arguments :
          <ol>
            <li>Position <i>(it is the center here)</i></li>
            <li>Radius of the sphere</li>
            <li>Color of the sphere</li>
            </ol>
            We need only two parameters to represent a sphere , its center and the radius of the sphere. Since this is ray tracing , we are colouring our spheres too here and hence the third argument of our function is the color of the sphere.
            <hr>
            add_sphere() returns the following variables :
            <ol>
                <li>Type is sphere</li>
                <li>Position </li>
                <li>Radius of the sphere</li>
                <li>Color of the sphere</li>
                <li>Reflectivity of the sphere </li>
                </ol> 
      </p>
      <p>For making the plane , we have created a function "add_plane()". It has the following arguments:
          <ol>
            <li> A position </li>
            <li> A normal </li>
            
          </ol>
          We need only two paramters two represent a plane , any one random point on the plane and the direction of the unit normal from that point to the plane. We are not taking any colour here since in the function we assign alternating black and white squares to our plane in the function itself.
          <hr>
          add_plane() returns the following variables :
          <ol>
            <li> A type plane </li>
            <li> A position </li>
            <li> A normal </li>
            <li> The colour , as intermitting black and white squares </li>
            <li> Diffuse_color </li>
            <li> Specular_color</li>
            <li> Reflection</li>
          </ol>
      </p>
      <B style="font-size: 28px;">The idea behind a tracer</B><br><br>
      <p>We achieve a 2d image of a 3d scene here. We did this in the following steps:
          <li>We stationed a light source ( <i>white light here</i>) at one point on our 3D plane , and a camera on another point on the 3D plane. Now we allow our camera to scan through our entire window <i>(currently at 400px x 300px)</i> , pixel by pixel. For this we send rays from the camera to the center of that particular pixel. The origin point of this ray is called as ray origin and the direction of the ray is stored as ray direction. Now , we move along with the ray and check for any intersection with an object. If there were no intersection , we return the background colour . If it intersects , we proceed further.</li>

                      <b>Intersection of the ray with sphere</b>
                      <p>We assumed that our ray starting from ray origin and going in direction ray direction is going to intersect our sphere at two points. We found out '<u>l</u>' , the vector from rayorigin to '<u>C</u>' , the centre of our sphere. We draw a perpendicular from <u>C</u> to our ray which intersects it at '<u>tca</u>'. We then use the pythagoras theorem to find '<u>thc</u>'. Now to get the intersection points '<u>t0</u>' and '<u>t1</u>' we can add and subtract '<u>thc</u>' to '<u>tca</u>'. The nearest point of the two will be '<u>t</u>'. Now , we want to access this point in terms of rayorigin and raydirection. Hence we represent it at '<u>phit</u>' in the picture or '<u>M</u>' in our code.</p>

                      <b>Intersection of the ray with plane</b>
                      <p>We have represented our plane using one random point on the plane , '<u>P0</u>'' and a normal away from the plane '<u>N</u>'. Assuming that the ray intersects the plane at '<u>P</u>', any ray '<u>P0-->P</u>' will always be perpendicular to our normal '<u>N</u>' and hence, their dot product will always be zero.We use this condition to check if there is any point of intersection in our code.</p>

                      Getting ahead with reflection and shadows
                  </b>
                  <p>We store our point of intersection as '<u>t</u>' , be it sphere or plane. To traverse to a this point from ray origin , we use a variable '<u>M = rayO + rayD * t</u>'. Another variable '<u>N</u>' to get the variable from that point away from the object which our ray has just hit.We consider '<u>M</u>' as our <i>pseudo-rayorigin</i>and '<u>M-->L</u>' as our <i>pseudo-raydirection</i>. We again check for any intersections , and if there are any intersections , we return a shadow ( or black colour ) . If there are no more intersection , we go ahead with colouring our objects.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Colouring</b>
                    <p>We assign the colour we stored in the variable '<u>ambient</u>' to colour our light ray. It can be any color , we have used a shade of white here.</p><br>
                    <p>For diffusion of colors, i.e. , each colour will have some diffusion coefficient to it for coloring, depending on how the light touches it. The ray touching the object at a perfect 90 degrees will give it the best colour while an angle 0f 0 degrees will give it 0 (black) colour. We increase the ray colour by a fraction, with 1 being the highest.This is known as Lambert shading.</p><br>
                    <p>We have also added Blinn-Phong shading. It is used for highlighting the pixel where light hits the sphere squarely, that is , it will be completely illuminated ,i.e. , in white colour.This is an optional feature we added up .</p>
                </li>
                <p>Finally, we repeat the complete process untill the complete image . The final image looks something like this :
