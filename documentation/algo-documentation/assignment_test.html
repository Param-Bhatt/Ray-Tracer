              <h3>Issues in Coding</h3><br>
              <p style="font-size: 20px;"><t>
                <ul>
                  <li>The first and the main issue we found was in the idea and writing the algorithm for our tracer. It took us a lot of time and research to understand the complete geometry involved behind the working of a simple tracer. We misunderstood some things in between and hence were setback in the middle too. However , we finally did understand the complete geometry as explained in project and wrote out the algorithm for it.</li><br>
                  <li>Another issue we faced was in implementing the entire algorithms together as one.Some of the issues include background being white led to the shadows being white . We also generated shades using diffusion coefficient for colouring our objects accordingly ( This is called Lambert Shading ) and also used Blinn-Phong shading for illumiating the spot where light is concentrated the most. </li><br>
                  <li>Often, we had to readjust our code and update it accordingly as some of the light rays would not illuminate one particular spot, or illuminated one spot only and ignored all the rest. However, when it all ended and fell into place as one program , we really loved our output obtained and our code runs successfully as of now.</li></ul></t></p><br>

              <h3>General Discussion </h3><br>
              <p style="font-size: 20px;"><t>
                <ul>
                  <li>It takes a lot of effort to write a tracer , especially if you dont know what you are doing in the first place. We had to sit down , and take a proper read through not only the entire papers but also multiple youtube videos. After all this, we referred some other websites too for further information of functions that we needed and implementing our ideas.</li><br>
                  <h2>Result:</h2><br><li>After all of our efforts , we feel we have successfully implemented our research paper that we had chosen, and it is a fun tool to even play around with. For example, we tried making negative image of our scene , and it worked wonderfully too. This program , can also help in explaining a lot of sub topics of ray optics that we learnt in physics during our intermediate as well as 10th class.</li><li>In addition to this , we also learnt about how tracers in general work, how the depth that we allow a tracer affects it effectivness as well as accuracy in the image , and the time that it takes to build it. We also realise that scanning each pixel individually is not the most optimised solution for a tracer.</li><br>
